# MTG Hub

Come on, give it a try! https://mtg-hub.vercel.app/

As a great fan of the trading card game Magic: the Gathering, as soon as I discovered that the famous site Scryfall (https://scryfall.com) offers free access to its API I decided that I absolutely had to carry out a project.

In the end, what resulted is a site that incorporates both the graphics and the main features of the site itself, with a personal touch from the point of view of graphics and information available to the user.

Specifically, I went to remove all the data that I deemed useless to the average player, as in most cases the necessary information is quite basic. At the beginning of the README file there is a link to visit the site, for any feedback do not hesitate to contact me!
